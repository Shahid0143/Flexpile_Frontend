Edit Note: Click on a note's text content to start editing it. Click outside the input field to save changes.
Delete Note: Click on the delete button (cross icon) to remove a note.
Drag Notes: Drag notes around the board to reposition them.
Pin/Unpin Note: Pin or unpin a note using the pin icon. Pinned notes cannot be dragged.
Technologies Used
React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
React Icons: Library providing a collection of icons for use in React projects.
HTML5 Drag and Drop API: Used for dragging notes around the board.

Issues and Limitations

Mobile Support: Drag and drop functionality might not work on mobile devices due to limitations with touch events and the HTML5 drag-and-drop API.
Future Enhancements

Add additional customization options for notes (color, size, etc.).
Implement user authentication and data persistence for multiple users.
